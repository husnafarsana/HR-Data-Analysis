This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI to provide key insights into workforce trends and employee attrition. The dashboard highlights overall HR metrics such as total employees, active employees, attrition count, attrition rate, and average age. It also breaks down attrition across different departments, education fields, and age groups, while visualizing employee demographics by gender and age band. In addition, the dashboard presents job satisfaction ratings across various roles using heatmap-style visuals, enabling quick identification of areas requiring HR attention.

The data was prepared in Excel and imported into Power BI for visualization. Different chart types such as pie charts, donut charts, bar charts, cards, and matrix visuals were used to represent the data in an interactive and insightful way. The dashboard helps HR professionals understand attrition drivers, monitor employee demographics, and evaluate job satisfaction trends effectively. 

This repository contains the Power BI file (`HR Data_project.pbix`), the dataset (`HR Data_project.xlsx`) . Users can download the Power BI file, connect it to the dataset, and interact with the visuals directly. Future improvements include adding time-based attrition trends, integrating predictive analysis, and publishing the report in Power BI Service for broader accessibility.
